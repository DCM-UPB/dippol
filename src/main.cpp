// The aim of this program is to simulate SFG spectra.
// The dipole moment and the polarizability are calculated
// thanks to first order approximation

// BE CAREFUL
// To write the code I supposed that:
// 1)The position file is constituted of water only (dummy atoms for TIP4P can be included)
// 2)The water model is not flexible (easy calculation of the bissector)
// 3)The O and H are never splitted because of pbc
